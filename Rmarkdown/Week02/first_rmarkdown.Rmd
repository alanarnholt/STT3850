## For Loop Statement

- The following code will display the contents of the vector z in reverse
order.
    
    i. Note that the first statement is needed so R will recognize that you are creating a numeric object within the loop.

    ii. Without the revers.z<-numeric() command, R will display an error message saying object reverse.z not found.
    
```{r}
reverse.z<-numeric()
z<-1:10
for (k in 1:10)
{reverse.z[k]<-z[10-k+1]
}
reverse.z
```

## R Markdown


**R Markdown** provides an easy way to produce rich, fully-documented, reproducible analyses.


1. It allows users to share a single file containing

    - all of the comments,
    - R code, and
    - metadata needed to reproduce the analysis from beginning to end.

2. R Markdown allows you to

    - combine chunks of R code with Markdown text and produce a nicely formatted HTML, PDF, or Word file,
    
    - without having to know any HTML or LaTeX code or fuss with getting the formatting just right in a Microsoft Word DOCX file.

I think youâ€™ll be pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to write an R
Markdown document once you get the hang of it.


### Create New R Markdown File

To *open* a new file, click on the little green plus on the upper left hand
and select R Markdown; see Figure below.

```{r `echo`=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("how.to.open.rmd.png")
```

## Equations 

$y = mx + b$


Multiply 7 by 14 gives us the result `r 7*14`.
