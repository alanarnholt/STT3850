## Quarto

Quarto enables you to _weave_ together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

### Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

## Ordered Lists

  i. This is the first item.
  ii. This is the second item.
  
  1. Different number.
  2. Another number.
  
## Equations

$$y = mx + b$$

Multiplying 7 by 14 gives us the result `r 7*14`.

## Code Chunks

```{r, echo = FALSE}
5 + 15 > 19
```
