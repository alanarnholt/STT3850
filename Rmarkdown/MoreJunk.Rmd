#### R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the __Knit__ button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure, col = "steelblue", pch =19)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

$\int_{-2}^{-1}sin(x)\, dx$

$8 + (4/7)^3 = `r 8 + (4/7)^3`$

```{r}
8 + (4/7)^3
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::spin("../Rscripts/TodaysJunk.R")
```
