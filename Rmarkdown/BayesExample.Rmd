A pap smear is a screening procedure to detect cervical cancer.  For women with this cancer, there are about 16% _false negatives_; that is

$$P(T^- = \text{test negative} | C = \text{cancer}) = 0.16; P(T^+ = \text{test positive} | C = \text{cancer}) = 0.84.$$
For women without cancer, there are about 19% _false positives_; that is

$$P(T^+ =\text{test positive} | C' = \text{not cancer}) = 0.19.$$
What is the probability a woman who tests positive actually has cancer ($P(C | T^+)$) if there are about 8 women in 100,000 who have this cancer in the United States? ($P(C) = 0.00008$) 

$$P(C | T^+) = \frac{P(C \cap T^+)}{P(T^+)} =\frac{P(C) \times P(T^+| C)}{P(T^+)} = \frac{P(C) \times P(T^+| C)}{P(C) \times P(T^+| C) + P(C') \times P(T^+| C')} = \frac{0.00008 \times 0.84}{0.00008 \times 0.84 + 0.99992 \times 0.19} = `r (0.00008*0.84)/(0.00008*0.84 + 0.9992*0.19)`$$
