# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the __Knit__ button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure, col = "pink", pch = 19, main = "You put something here", cex = 3)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
grades <- c(22, 78, 92)
mean(grades)
```


$4 + 11=$

$$\bar{x} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{x_i}{n} = \frac{22 + 78 + 92}{3} = `r (22+78+92)/3` = `r mean(grades)`$$
