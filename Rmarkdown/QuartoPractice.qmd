```

* Use $\LaTeX$ to write the sample variance.

$$s^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}$$

* Find and report the sample variance of `temp` for the data frame `weather`.

```{r}
weather |> 
  summarize(S2 = var(temp, na.rm = TRUE)) -> ans2
ans2
```

The sample variance for `weather` is `r round(ans2$S2, 2)`.

The mean of `temp` is ($\bar{x} = `r round(mean(weather$temp, na.rm = TRUE),1)`$).
