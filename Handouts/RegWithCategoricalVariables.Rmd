1. Report the average life expectancy for Africans in 1980 using `lifeexp_mod`.

<div id="answer">

+ The average life expectancy for Africans in 1980 was `r T2[1,2] %>% pull()` years.

</div> 

2. Report the average life expectancy for Europeans in 1980 using `lifeexp_mod`.

<div id="answer">

+ The average life expectancy for Europeans in 1980 was `r T2[1,2] %>% pull() + T2[4,2] %>% pull()` years.

Note: `moderndive` wrapper functions round answers.  This is not always a good thing.  It is best to leave the rounding until the very end! Consider the following inline R code.

+ The average life expectancy for Europeans in 1980 was `r coef(lifeexp_mod)[1] + coef(lifeexp_mod)[4]` years.  Which if you want to round to three decimal places would be: `r round(coef(lifeexp_mod)[1] + coef(lifeexp_mod)[4],3)` years.  Another way to get the desired answer is with the `predict()` function.  The average life expectancy for Europeans in 1980 was `r predict(lifeexp_mod, newdata = data.frame(continent = "Europe"))` years.
