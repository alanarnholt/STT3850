1. Report the average life expectancy for Africans in 1982 using `lifeexp_mod`.


```{r}
T2[1, 2] %>% pull()
coef(lifeexp_mod)[1]
```

+ The average life expectancy for Africans in 1982 was `r T2[1,2] %>% pull()` years.  Or, one could use `coef(lifeexp_mod)[1]` to return `r  coef(lifeexp_mod)[1]` years. 


2. Report the average life expectancy for Europeans in 1982 using `lifeexp_mod`.



```{r}
T2[1,2] %>% pull() + T2[4,2] %>% pull()
coef(lifeexp_mod)[1] + coef(lifeexp_mod)[4]
round(coef(lifeexp_mod)[1] + coef(lifeexp_mod)[4],3)
predict(lifeexp_mod, newdata = data.frame(continent = "Europe"))
```


+ The average life expectancy for Europeans in 1982 was `r T2[1,2] %>% pull() + T2[4,2] %>% pull()` years.

Note: `moderndive` wrapper functions round answers.  This is not always a good thing.  It is best to leave the rounding until the very end! Consider the following inline R code.

+ The average life expectancy for Europeans in 1982 was `r coef(lifeexp_mod)[1] + coef(lifeexp_mod)[4]` years.  Which if you want to round to three decimal places would be: `r round(coef(lifeexp_mod)[1] + coef(lifeexp_mod)[4],3)` years.  Another way to get the desired answer is with the `predict()` function.  The average life expectancy for Europeans in 1982 was `r predict(lifeexp_mod, newdata = data.frame(continent = "Europe"))` years.

 

```{r}
names(gapminder1982)
mod_full <- lm(lifeexp ~ gdppercap*continent, data = gapminder1982)
mod_simple <- lm(lifeexp ~ gdppercap, data = gapminder1982)
anova(mod_simple, mod_full)
anova(mod_full)
modpar <- lm(lifeexp ~ gdppercap + continent, data = gapminder1982)
summary(modpar)
library(moderndive)
ggplot(data = gapminder1982, aes(x = gdppercap, y = lifeexp, color = continent)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_parallel_slopes(se = FALSE) + 
  theme_bw()
