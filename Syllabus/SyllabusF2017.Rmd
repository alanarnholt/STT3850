**Course Description:**  

This course introduces students at the post-calculus level to statistical concepts, applications, and theory. Topics include: comparisons with categorical and numerical data, statistical significance, sampling and sampling distributions, and randomized experiments. Statistical concepts will be developed through simulations, and applications will focus on statistical problem-solving.  Students will complete three research projects using principles of reproducible research.

**Course Objectives:**

1.  Students will learn how to use a reproducible research work flow.
2.  Students will improve their technology expertise.
3.  Students will learn to work with large data sets.
4.  Students will learn to create and present graphs for both univariate and multivariate data.
5.  Students will learn how to construct and test hypotheses using both classical and randomization approaches.
6.  Students will learn how to construct confidence intervals using both classical and bootstrap approaches.
7.  Students will learn how to generate random and simple random samples and their relationships to permutation and bootstrap distributions.
8.  Students will learn how to work with named sampling distributions (*t*, *F*, binomial, chi-square, hypergeometric, and normal).
9.  Students will learn the scope of inferential conclusions for numerous scenarios (experiments, observational studies, etc.).

**Course Grading:**

* 54% of the course grade will come from the nine course labs (6% each lab)

* 30% of the course grade will come from the three course projects (10% each project) 

* 16% of the course grade will come from the Midterm exam


If you know you will be absent at any point in the semester for any reason, please let me know beforehand; and make sure to submit your work via [CrowdGrader](http://www.crowdgrader.org/) before the due date.  

      

**How To Get Unstuck**

Please ask questions on the [STT 5811 piazza account](https://piazza.com/class/iq8iqvom1771j4). Your classmates may have the same question or may answer your question before I can provide an answer.  Well constructed questions will elicit answers more rapidly than poorly constructed questions.  This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFaWxxzouCY&list=PLjTlxb-wKvXNSDfcKPFH2gzHGyjpeCZmJ&index=3) provides some background on asking questions.  This stackoverflow thread details how to create a [minimal R reproducible example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example/5963610#5963610). Please read [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric Raymond and Rick Moen and heed their advice.
