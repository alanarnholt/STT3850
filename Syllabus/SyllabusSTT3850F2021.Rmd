**Course Description:**  

This course provides an overview of modern statistical data analysis. Programming with data, including simulations and bootstrapping, will be an integral part of the course. Techniques for parsing univariate and multivariate data sets will be examined. Coverage of probability, random variables, standard probability distributions and statistical sampling distributions will be sufficient to prepare the student for statistical inference. Inferential topics will include parameter estimation, hypothesis testing for proportions, means and medians, goodness of fit tests, and tests for independence. Standard and computationally intensive regression techniques may also be covered. (NUMERICAL DATA; COMPUTER) — Prerequisite: MAT 1110

_______

**Course Objectives:**

1. Students will learn how to use a reproducible research work flow.
2. Students will improve their technology expertise.
3. Students will learn to work with large data sets.
4. Students will learn to create and present graphs for both univariate and multivariate data.
5. Students will learn how to construct and test hypotheses using both classical and randomization approaches.
6. Students will learn how to construct confidence intervals using both classical and bootstrap approaches.
7. Students will learn how to generate random and simple random samples and their relationships to permutation and bootstrap distributions.
8. Students will learn how to work with named sampling distributions (t, F, binomial, chi-square, and normal).
9. Students will learn the scope of inferential conclusions for numerous scenarios (experiments, observational studies, etc.).

**Course Grading & Assessment:**

The only way to learn statistics is to **DO** statistics, which includes using statistical software. Reading the textbook, learning the language, and practicing exercises using real data are critical to your learning and success. Class activities and assessments have been structured with these principles in mind.

You should read assigned textbook content and read/watch supplemental materials **prior** to coming to class. It will be easier to participate if you acquire some familiarity with the vocabulary and methods before we start to discuss and use them. You must “speak the language” (both statistics and R) to demonstrate your knowledge effectively.

Appalachian students are expected to make intensive engagement with courses their first priority. Practically speaking, students should spend approximately 2-3 hours on coursework outside of class for every hour they spend in class. For this four-hour course, you you should anticipate **8-12** hours per week of outside work.

__________

* 25% of the course grade will come from DataCamp assignments 

* 40% of the course grade will come from nine Problem Sets and a Sampling Distributions Lab

* 25% of the course grade will come from the Final written assignment

* 10% of the course grade will come class attendance and participation

**How To Get Unstuck**

Well constructed questions will elicit answers more rapidly than poorly constructed questions.  This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFaWxxzouCY&list=PLjTlxb-wKvXNSDfcKPFH2gzHGyjpeCZmJ&index=3) provides some background on asking questions.  This stackoverflow thread details how to create a [minimal R reproducible example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example/5963610#5963610). Please read [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric Raymond and Rick Moen and heed their advice.
